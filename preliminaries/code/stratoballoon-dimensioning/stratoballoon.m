%	Polyethilyene (PE) Stratospheric Balloon Dimensioning. Quite valid as well for Latex balloons.
%	by Oleguer Nogu√©s, June 2013
%
%	This script computes the required dimensions of a stratospheric baloon (volume and skin surface area) given a certain target altitude. 
% 	The script takes into account the parameters that influence the problem:
%
%	1) pressure (P) and temperature (T) versus altitude (H) (average atmosphere model)
%	2) Molar weight of atmospheric air (Ma) and Helium (Mhe)
%	3) Weight of the Payload (Wp)
%	4) Weight of the balloon (Wb), mainly driven by the surface density (Rb, in g/m^2) of the material used to craft the balloon skin
%	5) Temperature difference between Helium and outer air (dT), which may be induced by greenhouse effect of the ballon, when sun rays impinge on it.
%
%	We assume that the balloon is open thru its base, so that the Helium inside the balloon has the same pressure as that of the air outside.
%	Regarding the Helium temperature we consider two cases: one in which the Helium is at the same temperature (no influence of sun radiation)
%	and another in which the helium is at higher temperature (up to 50 degrees higher, as reported in some web articles).
%	At ground level, the balloon is partially filled, only with enough Helium so that it provides a lift that is a bit more than the weight, just enough to push up.
%	As the balloon climbs up the pressure decreases and the helium expands, and fills more of the available balloon volume. At a certain altitude the Helim fills the whole
%	volume, and starts to spill thru the lower neck of the ballon. At this moment the ballon will loose helium if it goes higher (as the pressure keeps dcreasing), and this
%	is thus the altitude in which it reaches equilibrium (lift equal to weight). For a Latex balloon the situation is not exactly as this one, as the Latex may infer some pressure 
%	differential between the inside and the outside of the balloon, but probably this difference can be neglected for first approach dimensioning estimations? (TBC)
%
%	The advantage of a Latex balloon is that it will climb as far as the Latex resists. One could even think of carrying big payloads with many latex balloons.
%	The disadvantage is that the latex balloon can be used only once, as it will end up exploting.
%
%	The advantage of polyethilene balloons is that they reach an altitude limit and they do not explote, thus enabling long-term missions, and even opening the possibility to control
%	ballon altitudes, and making controlled descents. The disadvantage is that construction of such big balloons might be not stright-forward (at the beginning). Though learning it
%	may provide a competitive advantage and --maybe-- open a business opportunity?
